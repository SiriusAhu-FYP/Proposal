% This project is timely. While the market demand is clear, the technological feasibility for a \textbf{reproducible, non-API-dependent} assistant has only recently emerged. Foundational research is now converging on the key methodologies required for productization. This includes the development of \textbf{unified evaluation protocols} and \textbf{modular ablation frameworks}, which are essential for ensuring that experiments are reproducible and comparable \cite{ORAK, lmgame-bench}. Furthermore, recent work has demonstrated the viability of \textbf{General Computer Control (GCC)} pathways (i.e., screen-in, keyboard/mouse-out), confirming that capable agents can operate without relying on game-specific APIs \cite{CRADLE, ui-venus}.



% TODO: 模块化的skills/macro，方便社区开发适用于不同游戏的插件？✅后期必须要加

% TODO: 传给大模型的是处理后的图片？比如说用YOLO打标和位置？🤔后面再看
