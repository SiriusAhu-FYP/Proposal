The demand for interactive, companion-style AI in real-time entertainment is rising, yet current academic research is largely split, focusing on either purely functional task-completion or the fundamentals of relational AI. This project addresses this gap by designing, building, and validating a \textbf{novel, unified architecture} that blends both functional agency and proactive companionship.
The proposed methodology is a \textbf{hierarchical and modular system}. It is built on the game-agnostic \textbf{General Computer Control (GCC)} paradigm, which operates using only the ``screen-in, keyboard/mouse-out'' approach. This system features a central \textbf{``Orchestrator''} to delegate tasks to specialized, ``plug-and-play'' sub-modules, with all communication managed by a \textbf{Model Context Protocol (MCP) bus}.
These modules include a \textbf{Functional Core} for in-game actions (using a hybrid-latency model), a \textbf{Proactive Relational Core} (with a Live2D frontend) for companionship, and a \textbf{Safety Core} for error detection and recovery. The project will be validated using a rigorous, two-phased plan: first, functional competence will be tested in logic-based games (e.g., \textit{2048, Stardew Valley}), followed by a qualitative A/B user study in a complex, high-DOF environment (\textit{Minecraft, Genshin Impact}) to prove the unified system provides a measurably superior user experience. The primary contribution of this work will be a validated architectural blueprint for this new class of ``companion-agents'', demonstrating a prototype capable of the deeper, functional partnership that current literature lacks.
